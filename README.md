## About the proyect

Create zones in a unique way. Now it's easier than ever.

**We got tired of them being leaked so we decided to make them public.**

ba_zones allows you to create zones, assign a blip or a radius to them. you can also set them to do a specific function either when entering, leaving or inside the zone.

## Features

* **Configurable** - Every detail is configurable
* **Standalone** - No Framework? No problem
* **Easy to use** - Intuitively useable and easy to install
* **Peace Zone** - Too many killings in the zone? Disable PVP
* **Routing** - You can divide the zones by buckets (MORE FPS)

Inside **client.lua** are examples of how to create a zone.

## **Dependencies**:
* [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases)

## Installation

- Be sure to download the [latest release](https://github.com/ggrizlyy/ba_zones/releases) of the resource, it's always good to stay up to date.
- Place it somewhere inside the `resources` directory
- Add the resource to your `server.cfg` after dependencies to make sure it's started correctly at server startup:
```

```
